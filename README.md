Hello My name is Hassan and it was my first project in terms of this complexity i know it sound too childish to say this level of projectin term of complexity but that's how it is 
So it is a basic game that is about Text Based Adventure 
It contains a player that reaches a cursed land and then the game proceeds 
in this game player was given choices to make as he proceeds in the game 
it also contain differnt monster Rooms Items/rewards....
So it is just a basic game in early stages..
